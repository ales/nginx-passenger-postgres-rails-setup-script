 The current issue is what version of ruby and what gems passanger is using. Right now it is using the default version which
 does not have bundle and crap set up, so I must find where ruby is installed right now and tell that to passanger.

 
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;



------------ FROM DEFAULT CONF ------------
passenger_root /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/phusion_passenger/locations.ini;
passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;

# ----------------------- NOTES ---------------
# Nginx with Passenger support was successfully installed.
#
# Please edit your Nginx configuration file (probably /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf),
# and set the passenger_root and passenger_ruby configuration options in the
# 'http' block, like this:
#
#   http {
#       ...
#       passenger_root /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.0/gems/passenger-4.0.26;
#       passenger_ruby /usr/local/bin/ruby;
#       ...
#   }
#
# After you (re)start Nginx, you are ready to deploy any number of Ruby on Rails
# applications on Nginx.
